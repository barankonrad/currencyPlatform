# Multi-currency transfer platform
The platform allows you to store amounts in different currencies and perform currency transfers. Amounts are converted at the exchange rate available at the time at which the operation is performed. User logs via login and password. Passwords are hashed with SHA256 and a salt. The project operates on simplified database, which simulates real system.

# Project goals
The main purpose of the project is to find usage of the acquired knowledge of MSSQL transactions, develop JavaFX skills and get familiar with using API. Moreover, the project uses password hashing with a salt, as I have always been curious about this.
